# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

1. Churn Analysis
 This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to understand the patterns and factors influencing customer churn.

2. Objective
 The primary goal is to uncover trends, identify key variables affecting churn, and prepare the data for further modeling. The analysis provides insights into 
 customer behavior, service usage, and billing patterns.A dynamic, Interective data visualisation tool built to explore sales data of a store on reasonal comparisons.

3. Tools & Libraries:
-> Python
-> Numpy-Numerical operation
-> Pandas-Data manuplation
-> Matplotlib-Data visualization

4. Dataset
  The dataset contains information on telecom customers, including demographics, services signed up for, billing information, and whether the customer has churned.

5. This EDA forms the foundation for deeper statistical analysis and machine learning modeling. It helps identify important customer attributes linked to churn
